Usage
After setting up the project, you can run the development server:

Copy
npm run dev
or

bash
Copy
yarn dev
This will start the Vite development server and you can view the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Development
Vite provides a fast development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so when you make changes to the code, the changes will automatically reflect in the browser without needing a page reload.

1. To start development
bash
Copy
npm run dev
or

bash
Copy
yarn dev
This will open up the app on your local server at http://localhost:3000.

2. To build the project for production
bash
Copy
npm run build
or

bash
Copy
yarn build
This will generate an optimized build in the dist directory.

3. To preview the production build locally
bash
Copy
npm run preview
or

bash
Copy
yarn preview
This will start a local server to preview the production build.
